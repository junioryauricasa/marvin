Marvin
======

Marvin is a **micro CMS** for PHP 5.3+.


## Why micro CMS?

Currently most used and beloved CMS solutions, such as WordPress, Drupal and Joomla are great, if you're
building big websites for tech-savvy customers, who are not afraid of using complex administration
systems. But if you want to make just a simple few-page website, those systems are huge **overkill**.

Currently used content management systems are really hard to use for a basic user. Too many options doesn't
make users just confused, it enables them to screw things up and that makes them afraid to use system at all.


## What is Marvin?

Marvin is [a robot with a brain big as a planet](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marvin_the_Paranoid_Android) and also a simple CMS for PHP 5.3+.

But Marvin is not yet another CMS you need to learn from ground up. It is based on wonderful [Silex framework](http://silex.sensiolabs.org)
which is build on the shoulders of Symfony2 and Pimple. That means it's fully tested and verified by thousands of developers.

Marvin is developed with **Test Driven Development (TDD)** approach using [PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de) for testing backend and [QUnit](http://qunitjs.com) for testing JavaScript.

Default database is set to [SQLite](http://www.sqlite.org), but thank's to Silex it works out of the box with MySQL, PostgreSQL or Oracle, too.

Frontend is build using famous [Bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com), so you don't have to learn new conventions even here.

It's distributed via [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) and frontend uses full advantage of [Grunt](http://gruntjs.com) and [Bower](http://bower.io).

And the best part? It's **open source and free under MIT license**.
